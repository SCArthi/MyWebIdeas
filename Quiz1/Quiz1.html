				The concept of "two sets of books" refers to the practice of attempting to
				hide or disguise certain financial transactions from outsiders by having a set 
				of fraudulent accounting records (or "books") for official use and another, 
				the real set, for personal records.</font></p>
			
			<p>Keeping two sets of books has its disadvantages and advantages.
				The concept of having two sets of books is so public traded companies
				can prepare the financial statements for the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors,
				and sometimes the IRS. This is considered an advantage because it shows the investors that 
				they are a rich company. 
				
				<br>
				
				Therefore, they can get more shareholders to buy their stocks. The
				disadvantage with these companies for having two sets of books is when they report one or 
				both of the books to the Internal Revenue Service, they tend to lower their income to 
				avoid taxes.[1]</p>
